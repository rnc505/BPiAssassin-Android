This project is my final submission for the CS-279: Software Engineering Project course at Vanderbilt.

It is a Facial Recognition App in the form of a game on Android.

It requires 2 cameras on the device (front and back).

Preferably requires Internet connection and a sim card capable of sending/receiving SMS.
